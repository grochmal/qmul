# QMUL PhD files

`glio`, `golub` and `mds` are datasets that has never been used.  They're from
previous experiments which I do not remember the provenance anymore.

`mock-prop`, `report` and `rimpres` are LaTeX reports used through the PhD, all
of them are distributed under the GNU GPL version 3 or (at your option) any
later version as published by the FSF.  The files in these directories are
under Copyright (C) 2016 Michal Grochmal.
